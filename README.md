1. Research software
	- Be aware there is an [eScience guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/).
	- Skim through [the Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html). More specifically:
		- [Guide for Reproducible Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research.html)
		- [Guide for Project Design](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-design.html)
	- These are reference guides. No need to read through them
2. Programming paradigms
	- Programming across paradigms. [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg3UeB-5FdA) and [slides](https://files.gotocon.com/uploads/slides/conference_3/78/original/Programming%20across%20Paradigms.pdf). Up to minute 23, really great intro. The rest is optional
	- ~~[Programming Paradigms – Paradigm Examples for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/)~~ Not very good, according to [[Lourens Veen]].
	- ~~[Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps8jOj7diA0) to programming paradigms course.~~ Not great either
3. Data structures and algorithms
	- Data structure, Algorithms, basics of sorting & searching, freeCodeCamp.org [Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&t=854s). See first comment and use it to browse to the interesting parts
	- Data Structures and Algorithms, by John Bullinaria, School of Computer Science University of Birmingham [Lecture Notes](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/DSA/dsa.pdf). Good lecture notes/reference material for those who prefer a text-based approach.
	- ~~Data Structures and Algorithms in Python? by freeCodeCamp.org [online course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA)~~. 12 hours? No way
